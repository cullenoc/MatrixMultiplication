# MatrixMultiplication
Matrix multiplication implemented in parallel with OpenMP and AVX intrinsics.
Naive implementation explained and adapted from [CS 149 gemm handout](https://github.com/stanford-cs149/gemm_extra_credit)
and dot product from [kshitijl's avx2-examples](https://github.com/kshitijl/avx2-examples/blob/master/examples/04-dot-product.c).
